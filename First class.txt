3rd Commit.
The third commit I am doing is to write the step how to make repositry steps.

1- Make a repositry in github and then copy the url.
2- In the specific folder write in the top folder name cmd instead.
// before proceding install git into your pc from the brower simply write git.
3- Write in cmd git clone and paste url of your github you copied in step 1 it will download or clone your github repositry to your specific folder you selected.
4- write cd ( repositry folder name you just cloned to your pc)
5- write code .
6- Make a new file in vs code you just opened and write name of file with .txt.
7- Write some thing in it.
8- Write git commit -m "your message" ( here you can write anything)
// it will require your email and user name for one time only.
9- Write git push to push your file or export you file to github.
// For the first time you need to sign in with your user name and password and verify it in the brower.
10- Now check your repositry in the github.
